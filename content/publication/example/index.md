abstract: >
  Image signal processing (ISP) is crucial for camera imaging, and neural
  networks (NN) solutions are extensively deployed for daytime scenes. The lack
  of sufficient nighttime image dataset and insights on nighttime illumination
  characteristics poses a great challenge for high-quality rendering using
  existing NN ISPs. To tackle it, we first built a high-resolution nighttime
  RAW-RGB (NR2R) dataset with white balance and tone mapping annotated by expert
  professionals. Meanwhile, to best capture the characteristics of nighttime
  illumination light sources, we develop the CBUnet, a two-stage NN ISP to
  cascade the compensation of color and brightness attributes. Experiments show
  that our method has better visual quality compared to traditional ISP
  pipeline, and is ranked at the second place in the NTIRE 2022 Night
  Photography Rendering Challenge for two tracks by respective People’s and
  Professional Photographer’s choices.
